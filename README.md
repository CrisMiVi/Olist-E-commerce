## Problems
Olist currently struggles with limited visibility into who its best customers are and how often they come back, unpredictable delivery performance across sellers and regions, and no reliable way to forecast sales or manage inventory by category. At the same time, customer feedback goes unanalyzed, marketplace dynamics (seller activity and seasonality) remain opaque, regional revenue patterns and fraud risks aren‚Äôt flagged, and there‚Äôs no benchmark against competitors. Solving these gaps will enable more targeted marketing, smoother operations, smarter inventory planning, stronger customer satisfaction, and a clearer competitive edge.

## Goals
1. **Identify & Target Customers**  
   Segment users via RFM and CLV analysis to focus marketing on high‚Äëvalue and at‚Äërisk cohorts.
2. **Optimize Logistics**  
   Build delivery‚Äëtime prediction models to reduce delays, negotiate SLAs, and lower shipping costs.
3. **Align Inventory & Sales**  
   Forecast revenue and product demand (ARIMA/Prophet) for smarter stock planning and promotional timing.
4. **Enhance Customer Experience**  
   Analyse review sentiment and topics to pinpoint quality issues and drive improvements in products and service.
5. **Mitigate Risk & Benchmark**  
   Detect transactional anomalies for fraud prevention and measure operational metrics against competitors.
